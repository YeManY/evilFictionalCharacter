	<p>Meruem is amoral, he was born into a destiny and a role that he accepted and took pride in at first, but that slowly became stale as he 
	slowly and simultaneously learned of the depth and wonder that is existence thanks to a few factors. The most important of them being a sweet 
	young woman named Komugi.</p></div>

	<p>Meruem plays a massive role in the Chimera Ant even at the very beginning, even before he's born. At the very start it's established that
	the Chimera Ant Queen is currently feasting as much as she can so she can give birth to an almighty king, it is his destiny to rule the world 
	with an iron fist. The stakes are immediately raised, we don't know anything about the king so far or what he's like but we know that he's bad
	news for the Hunters. A bit later we given an hint of what the kings power will be like through the Royal Guards, mainly Pitou, through Pitou's
	fight with Kite we are given a scope of what the kings power would be seeing how Pitou is the most powerful being is the series thus so far and 
	seeing how she's only his Royal Guard we're given a great idea of how powerful he is.</p>
